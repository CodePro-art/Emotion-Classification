# Emotion-Classification
Emotion recognition is the part of speech recognition that is gaining more popularity and the need for it is increasing enormously. Although there are methods to recognize emotion using machine learning techniques, this project attempts to use deep learning to recognize the emotions from data.
# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)

## Definition

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the process of identifying human emotions and affective states from speech signals. It leverages the understanding that voice often reflects underlying emotions through variations in tone, pitch, and other acoustic features. This concept is akin to how animals like dogs and horses can comprehend human emotions through vocal cues.

## Why we need it?

Emotion recognition, a subset of speech recognition, is gaining significant traction due to its various applications across industries. Traditional machine learning techniques have been employed for emotion recognition, but this project aims to utilize deep learning methodologies for more accurate and robust emotion classification from speech data.

### Examples of Applications

- **Call Centers:** SER can be utilized in call centers to classify customer calls based on emotional cues. This classification can serve as a performance metric for conversational analysis, helping companies identify unsatisfied customers and improve service quality.
  
- **Automotive Safety:** In-car systems can benefit from SER by monitoring the emotional state of drivers through speech analysis. This information can be used to enhance safety measures, such as alerting drivers who show signs of fatigue or distraction, thus reducing the likelihood of accidents.

## Datasets Used

- **Crowd-sourced Emotional Mutimodal Actors Dataset (Crema-D):** A dataset containing audio and visual recordings of actors performing emotional scenarios, providing a rich source for SER model training and evaluation.
  
- **Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (Ravdess):** This dataset comprises audio and visual recordings of actors displaying various emotions, offering diverse examples for SER research.
  
- **Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion (Savee):** Savee contains audio recordings of actors enunciating emotions, aiding in the development of robust SER models.
  
- **Toronto Emotional Speech Set (Tess):** Tess provides audio recordings of speakers expressing a range of emotions, contributing to the development and validation of SER algorithms.
